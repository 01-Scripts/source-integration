This plugin provides framework for fully integrating any sort of version 
control system with Mantis, including support for multiple repositories, 
changesets/revisions, and files/path tracking.  It has many features 
already, such as importing repository history and optional support for 
remote check-ins, and utilizes a class-based API to access objects in 
the database.

Initial support is included for Subversion repositories using WebSVN,
and Git repositories hosted on GitHub.  Support for more source control
tools is planned, but should be rather straightforward to implement, due
to the flexibility inherent in the integration framework and API.

Bug reports or fixes are highly encouraged, as are contributions via
GitHub's fork/pull-request methods.  Bug reports should be directed to
the bug tracker located at: http://leetcode.net/mantis
