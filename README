This plugin provides framework for fully integrating any sort of version 
control system with Mantis, including support for multiple repositories, 
changesets/revisions, and files/path tracking.  It has many features 
already, such as importing repository history and optional support for 
remote check-ins, and utilizes a class-based API to access objects in 
the database.

Initial support is included for Subversion repositories using WebSVN. 
This can still be used without WebSVN to track a repository's changesets 
and links to Mantis bugs, but the links to view changesets or files will 
not work.
